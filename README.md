# VSCode - PageCount README
 
This is based on the WordCount sample extension

## Functionality

It's pretty simple open up a text file (default configured to (*.md) files) and the status bar will have an auto-updating wordcount with approximated page count (words per page can be configured) in it...

It will also show you the stats of all files in sum.

You can configure for what files the stats should be shown, and which of those files should not count to the total.

The page approximation can be configured either using words or lines. And for both the number of words/lines per page can also be configured.
